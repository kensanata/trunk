# Trunk for Mastodon

Trunk allows you to mass-follow a bunch of people in order to get
started with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Mastodon is a
free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network.

Basically what happens is this repository contains a few lists of
accounts we recommend you follow if you're interested in a particular
topic.

If you click on one of the lists below, you'll see a page full of
recommended accounts. Click to see their timelines and follow them
individually, or click the big "follow them all" button at the top to
do just that.

In order for this web app to do this, you need to log in,
unfortunately. We're not storing your credentials. We have a session
cache of the last 50 accounts that used the service in memory because
we need to remember who you are when you're back from the login, but
this cache is not saved to disk.

These lists can potentially be very *long* but as I am writing this in
August 2018 we just launched so the lists are still very short.

If you want to be added or removed from a list, or if you'd like to
see another list, or if you have any other questions and concerns,
please [contact me via Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@kensanata).
Note that you cannot volunteer other people. People have to volunteer
themselves. Please encourage them to contact me!

(Also, since this is the early days, please know that there are
downtimes when I'm desperately trying to fix things, probably right
now! ðŸ˜¢)
