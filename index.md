# Trunk

Trunk allows you to mass-follow a bunch of *people* in order to get
started with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) or any other
platform on the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).
Mastodon is a free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network.

If you click on one of the lists below, you'll see a page full of
*people* that volunteered to be on that list. Yeah, *people*. Our
goal is to connect newbies with *people*. The only exception we have
is our [Organizations, NGOs & Associations](https://communitywiki.org/trunk/grab/Organisations,%20NGOs%20&%20Associations) list. All the other lists are about
*people*. Click to see their timelines and follow them. We hope this
helps you find some new people to follow.

Please remember that we're all
human and interests change and nobody promised to either an expert on
these topics or to be posting exclusively about these topics. And of
course, people change, or leave. ðŸ™‚

**If you want to read** about one or more of these topics, all you
have to do is click on the various lists linked below and follow the
people on these lists.

**If you write** about one or more of these topics and think that
people wanting to read about the topic might benefit if they followed
you, consider [volunteering for a list](/trunk/request).

Note that you cannot volunteer other people. People have to volunteer
themselves. Please encourage them to contact one of the
administrators!

## Administrators

If you want to be removed from a list, or if you'd like to see a new
list, or if you have any other questions and concerns, contact one of
the administrators via Mastodon.

As *Trunk* and the number of requests is growing, we kindly
ask you to mention just *one* of us. Thank you! ðŸ˜…
