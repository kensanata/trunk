# Trunk for Mastodon

Trunk allows you to mass-follow a bunch of people in order to get
started with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Mastodon is a
free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network.

Basically what happens is this repository contains a few lists of
accounts we recommend you follow if you're interested in a particular
topic.

If you click on one of the lists below, you'll see a page (a
potentially very *long* page!) full of recommended accounts. Click to
see their timelines and follow them individually, or click the big
"follow them all" button at the top to do just that.

In order for this web app to do this, you need to log in,
unfortunately.
