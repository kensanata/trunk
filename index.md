# Trunk for Mastodon

Trunk allows you to mass-follow a bunch of people in order to get
started with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Mastodon is a
free, open-source, decentralized microblogging network.

Basically what happens is this repository contains a few lists of
accounts we recommend you follow if you're interested in a particular
topic.

If you click on one of the lists below, you'll see a page (a
potentially very *long* page!) full of recommended accounts. Click to
see their timelines and follow them individually, or click the big
"follow them all" button at the top to do just that.

In order for this web app to do this, you need to log in,
unfortunately. We're not storing your credentials. We have a session
cache of the last 50 accounts that used the service in memory because
we need to remember who you are when you're back from the login, but
this cache is not saved to disk.

If you want to see another list, or be added to a list (or removed
from a list!), or if you have any other questions and concerns, please
[contact me via Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@kensanata).
