# Request to join

Hello and thank you for volunteering to be on one or more lists!
Newbies looking for people to follow are looking for people who fit
the list topic in some way, usually by posting about related issues.
If that's you, great! ðŸ™‚

Please provide the account you want to use (e.g.
*kensanata@octodon.social*), pick from the lists below, and click the
button at the bottom. This should open your web client and prepare a
toot so that all you have to do is click the *Toot!* button. Also,
remember to change the *visibility* to *Direct* (ðŸ–‚) before tooting, I
guess? ðŸ¤”

(Sadly, this only works for Mastodon as far as I know. Everybody else
just post their toots like your parents did, by hand!)

We're trying to help newbies find people to follow. If you have an
NGO account, or some other account that is mostly boosting news and
doesn't represent an actual, single person to talk to, we'll add you
to the [Organisations, NGOs & Associations](https://communitywiki.org/trunk/grab/Organisations,%20NGOs%20&%20Associations) list.
