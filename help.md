## Help! I'm getting an error!

There are two kinds of errors we know about.

1. If you're trying to subscribe to a list, and it takes about half a minute before you're getting an error, you might have a partial success: the list got created and people were added to it but eventually it timed out. And instance was down, or the list is too big, we're not quite sure. You can try again, or simply add the remaining accounts manually, one by one. In this case, send an email to Alex (see link at the very bottom): which account didn't get added? Perhaps these accounts need to be removed from the list and that'll fix it for everybody. ðŸ˜…

2. If you're trying to subscribe to a list, and it takes no time at all to get an error, then it depends: the Trunk server might have gotten its registration wrong. Send a message to Alex (see link at the very bottom) and say which account you used. Perhaps the existing registration can be deleted and you can then try again. Sadly, there's also the possibility that your instance is simply not compatible and nobody knows what the problem is. ðŸ˜“

## I'd like to help!

There are two kinds of help we need right now:

1. We'd like to get more moderators on the team! Your account will get listed on the [front page](https://communitywiki.org/trunk) and you'll start getting requests assigned to you. Use the (very simple) [admin pages](https://communitywiki.org/trunk/admin) to add people to lists, to create more lists, add descriptions to lists, and so on.

2. We'd like people to start more Trunk instances! We need Trunk instances for different languages and for special interests. What you need is a (small) server online. Alex will be able to help you get started (see link at the very bottom). Trunk is free software.
