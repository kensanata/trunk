Below are some people for you to follow. We suggest you go through the
list one by one and follow each person individually. Alternatively,
[export the list]($uri/csv/$name_encoded.csv) and import it via your
preferences.

If the links don't work, copy and paste the username into your
instance's search field and you'll get to their profile page anyway.

If you'd like to be on this list, **and your public profile shows at
least twenty posts you have written yourself, in English** (see the
[front page](/trunk) for an explanation), send us a
[request]($uri/request?$name_encoded=on). ðŸ™‚
