Below are some people for you to follow. If you click the first button
in order to follow them all, Trunk creates a list called *$name* for
your account and puts the people you're not already following into
this list. If you already have a list with the same name, don't worry:
you can have lists sharing the same name.

If this doesn't work for you (and unfortunately I've had quite a few
such reports ðŸ˜“), then you can still go through the list one by one
and follow each person individually.

And if you'd like to be on this list, send us a
[request]($uri/request?$name_encoded=on). ðŸ™‚
